# ChromeOverflowMenu

It is the animation that is present in the Overflow menu of Chrome Browser for Android.   
Not too much of work but it was nice to find out how things are animating and building  
them by slowing down the Animation duration in Developer options.  


Attached below is the video of the animation.
